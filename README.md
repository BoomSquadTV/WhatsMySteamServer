What’s My Steam Server (CDN) is a full-featured diagnostic and benchmarking utility designed to identify the fastest and most reliable Steam download region for your specific network conditions. Steam automatically selects a content server based on general heuristics, but these choices are not always optimal—especially for users with fluctuating latency, ISP routing issues, or when Steam’s regional servers are congested. This tool provides a transparent, data-driven way to discover which CDN endpoint actually delivers the best performance to you.

The application scans Steam’s entire global CDN network and performs targeted tests across each available region. During each scan, it measures critical network metrics such as latency (round-trip time), jitter, and packet loss, giving you a clear picture of how stable and responsive each server is. These results are aggregated, ranked, and presented with clear performance scoring so you can easily identify the optimal region for Steam downloads.

To make the data accessible, the program includes a built-in Tkinter GUI dashboard. This interface updates in real time, displaying results in a clean, sortable table that allows you to quickly compare server performance metrics. You can toggle between three scanning modes—Fast, Normal, and Best—depending on the depth of testing you need. “Fast” mode performs quick checks for rapid recommendations, while “Best” mode runs more robust multi-sample tests for highly accurate results.

The dashboard also provides options to customize your output, such as adjusting the number of top-performing regions shown in the ranked list. When you’re finished scanning, you can export all results in CSV format, making it easy to archive performance comparisons, share results, or analyze them further in external tools.

Designed with usability and transparency in mind, What’s My Steam Server (CDN) is ideal for gamers, network enthusiasts, and anyone looking to optimize their Steam download speeds. Whether you’re troubleshooting slow downloads, comparing ISPs, or simply fine-tuning your setup, this tool offers clear insights backed by real network data.
