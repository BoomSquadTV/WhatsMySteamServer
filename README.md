# What’s My Steam Server (CDN)

**What’s My Steam Server (CDN)** is a diagnostic and benchmarking utility designed to identify the fastest and most reliable Steam download region for your network. Steam’s automatic selection isn’t always optimal, especially with fluctuating latency, ISP routing issues, or regional server congestion. This tool provides a transparent, data-driven way to discover which CDN endpoint actually delivers the best performance to you.
